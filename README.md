## Branching Strategy 

To manage and streamline the codebase, the following branching strategy is adopted:

#### 1. Main Branch
- **Purpose:** Holds the final, production-ready version of the code.
- **Rules:**
  - Changes are only merged into main from the develop branch via pull requests (PRs).
  - The branch requires code reviews from team members before merging

#### 2. Develop Branch
- **Purpose:** Acts as the integration branch where team members merge their completed features or bug fixes.
- **Rules:**
  - All team members push their changes to feature branches and create PRs to merge into the develop branch.
  - The develop branch undergoes regular integration testing to ensure stability.
  - Once develop is stable and ready for release, a PR is created to merge it into the main branch.

#### 3. Feature Branches
- **Purpose:** Allow developers to work on individual features or bug fixes without affecting the develop branch.
- **Rules:**
  - Each team member creates their feature branch from the latest version of the develop branch.
  - Regularly rebase or merge the latest develop branch into the feature branch to avoid integration issues.
  - Once work is completed, create a PR to merge the feature branch into develop.

#### Command to find the number of commits: 
    git shortlog -sne --all --no-merges
  - This command when executed gives summary of the commits excluding the merge commits.
  - It is useful when you want to focus on individual contributions.
  - Run command in command prompt of local system, from the project directory.

## Maintain XP core values and practices

- **Foster a Culture of Transparent Dialogue**
 In the development of our Restaurant Finder app, we were committed to creating an environment where team members feel empowered to voice their ideas, concerns, and
suggestions openly. By encouraging honest conversations, we canouldidentify potential issues early and collaboratively find innovative solutions.

- **Implement Regular Feedback Loops**
 We established structured feedback sessions for each feature of the Restaurant Finder app through regular DSMs an KT sessions. These will include:
  - Weekly team check-ins to discuss progress on user interface design
  - Bi-weekly code reviews to ensure backend efficiency
  
- **Embrace Bold Ideas and foster Courage**
 We fostered an atmosphere where team members felt courageous enough to propose unconventional features for the Restaurant Finder app. This might include incorporating both Azure B2C as well as brainstorming on cost-efficient platforms to implement our functionality.

- **Constructive Criticism - Open Communication**
 Encourage team members to provide thoughtful, constructive feedback on all aspects of the Restaurant Finder app. This includes having the courage to respectfully challenge ideas, regardless of who proposes them, to ensure we're creating the best possible product.

- **Celebrate Risk-Taking**
 Recognize and applaud team members who step out of their comfort zones, such as Kartik working on Azure B2C for the first time and despite initial setbacks, Rahul implementing zip code search and front-end integration with no prior experience, Manu working in the backend team as a novice and Vandana doing project management. front-end development as a complete fresher.

## Running the Application 
---

This repository contains two applications:

**React Frontend**: Located in the react-app-finedine/ folder, it serves the client-side user interface.

**Spring Boot Backend**: Located in the springboot-app-finedine/ folder, it serves the server-side API and business logic.


### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

#### For React Frontend:
- Node.js: (Recommended version: LTS)
- A package manager: npm (default with Node.js) or yarn.

#### For Spring Boot Backend:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.
- Apache Maven.

#### Optional:
- Git for cloning the repository.

-----------
### Steps:

**1.‚Å† ‚Å†Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine:
    `git clone <repository-url>`
    `cd <repository-folder>`

**2.‚Å† ‚Å†Running the React Frontend**
Navigate to the react-app-finedine/ directory:
`cd react-app-finedine`

##### Install dependencies:

**Using npm:** `npm install`
**Using yarn:** `yarn install`

##### Start the development server:

**Using npm:** `npm start`
**Using yarn:** `yarn start`

*The React application will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.*

**3.‚Å† ‚Å†Running the Spring Boot Backend**
***Navigate to the backend/ directory:*** `cd springboot-app-finedine`

###### Build the application:
Run the following command to clean and install dependencies:

`mvn clean install`

###### Start the Spring Boot application:
Using Maven: `mvn spring-boot:run`

***The backend application will run on http://localhost:8080 by default.***

-----------

**4. Running Both Applications Together**

To run the React frontend and Spring Boot backend simultaneously:

Open two terminal windows or tabs.

##### In the first terminal:
Navigate to the react-app-finedine/ directory and start the React application.

##### In the second terminal:
Navigate to the springboot-app-finedine/ directory and start the Spring Boot application.

**Ensure the frontend makes API calls to the correct backend URL. Update the React app's .env file or configuration to use the backend API, e.g.:**

`REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
`
